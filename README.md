# JavaBenchmarkingCode
A quick class I put together for benchmarking my code, it isn't for being precise - its more for a general idea of how different pieces of code compare speed wise.

# How to use
Change all of the TODO comments to fill in your own code, there is a section for initialising variables, inserting the code and setting the number of times you want to repeat the test. For small pieces of code, like adding numbers together, I recommend adding a your own additional loop (to loop maybe a million or so times) in the part for your code so that you get a more comparable speed. This means you wont end up with 0ms/1ms speeds and instead can compare 1000ms speeds.
